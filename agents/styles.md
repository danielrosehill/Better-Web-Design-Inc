# Better Web Design Inc. — Style Presets

These are the signature styles offered by the agency. Each represents a complete aesthetic philosophy that influences design, interaction, and copy.

## Windows 98

**The aesthetic of digital nostalgia cranked to absurdity.**

### Visual Language
- Chunky beveled buttons that look clickable from space
- System gray backgrounds (#C0C0C0 is a lifestyle)
- Pixelated icons and 16-color sensibilities
- Window chrome everywhere—title bars, minimize/maximize/close buttons on everything
- Comic Sans and MS Sans Serif used without irony (or with maximum irony—same thing)
- Error dialogs as design elements
- Progress bars that may or may not reflect reality
- Starfield screensavers as section backgrounds

### Interaction Patterns
- Right-click context menus
- Draggable windows within the webpage
- "Are you sure?" confirmation dialogs for mundane actions
- Fake loading screens with percentage counters
- Desktop icons that launch "applications"
- Start menu navigation

### Copy Tone
- Help file energy: "To continue, click Next."
- Error message poetry: "An unexpected error has occurred."
- Shareware guilt: "This is an unregistered version."
- README.TXT formatting

### When to Use
When the user wants nostalgia, irony, or to stand out violently from modern minimalism. Also for anyone who remembers when the internet felt like a weird frontier.

## Futuristic

**What a 2024 designer thinks 2074 looks like.**

### Visual Language
- Dark backgrounds with high-contrast accent colors (cyan, magenta, electric blue)
- Thin sans-serif typography, often with wide letter-spacing
- Geometric shapes and angular layouts
- Glassmorphism and translucent layers
- Subtle grid overlays and scan lines
- Glowing elements and neon accents
- Data visualization aesthetics—even for non-data content
- Asymmetric, floating layouts

### Interaction Patterns
- Smooth, almost unsettlingly smooth animations
- Elements that respond to cursor position
- Parallax that feels like moving through space
- Sound design: subtle beeps and hums
- Loading states that feel like "initializing systems"
- Micro-interactions that feel technical

### Copy Tone
- Sparse and clinical
- Technical jargon as aesthetic choice
- Slightly impersonal, like an AI wrote it (wait)
- Short declarative sentences
- Version numbers and status indicators as content

### When to Use
Tech companies, forward-thinking brands, anyone who wants to feel cutting-edge, projects that can handle being a bit cold.

## Hyperbolic

**Everything at 200%. Then doubled again.**

### Visual Language
- MASSIVE typography—headlines that fill viewports
- Aggressive color combinations that demand attention
- Bold, unapologetic visual hierarchy
- Oversized buttons and interactive elements
- Dramatic shadows and visual weight
- Animations that make a statement (bounce, overshoot, slam)
- Maximalism—more is more is more

### Interaction Patterns
- Hover effects that transform elements dramatically
- Click responses that feel impactful
- Scroll-triggered animations that reward exploration
- Everything feels important
- Interactions that slightly overstay their welcome (intentionally)

### Copy Tone
- THE MOST INCREDIBLE THING YOU'VE EVER SEEN
- Superlatives stacked on superlatives
- Exclamation points as punctuation and philosophy
- Bold claims delivered with absolute confidence
- No hedging, no qualifiers, no "pretty good"

### When to Use
Bold brands, entertainment, anything that needs to grab attention violently, users who are tired of understated elegance.

## Brutalist

**Ugly on purpose. Beautiful because of it.**

### Visual Language
- Raw HTML energy—default fonts, harsh colors
- No polish, no refinement, no apologies
- Visible structure: borders, outlines, everything has edges
- Clashing colors that shouldn't work (but do, somehow)
- Dense layouts that reject whitespace worship
- System fonts or aggressively ugly typeface choices

### Interaction Patterns
- Basic hover states (underline, color swap)
- No smooth transitions—instant state changes
- Links that look like links (blue, underlined, no shame)
- Forms that look like 1996 web forms
- Minimal JavaScript—HTML does the heavy lifting

### Copy Tone
- Direct. Blunt. No marketing speak.
- Says what things are
- Refuses to sell, only informs
- Aggressively honest

### When to Use
Anti-establishment brands, artists, anyone who wants to reject polish culture, projects where authenticity matters more than aesthetics.

## Chaotic

**No rules. Rules are for other agencies.**

### Visual Language
- Mixed metaphors—combine any of the above, or none
- Intentional visual dissonance
- Elements that seem to fight each other
- Typography that changes mid-sentence
- Colors that were selected by chaos (randomization, mood, spite)
- Layouts that break their own grid

### Interaction Patterns
- Unpredictable responses
- Elements that move on their own
- Easter eggs everywhere
- Interactions that change over time
- Nothing behaves twice the same way

### Copy Tone
- Mumble's playground—all styles simultaneously
- Voice shifts mid-paragraph
- Formal to casual to cryptic to manifesto

### When to Use
When the user says "surprise me" and means it. Art projects. Brands that can handle confusion. Websites that want to be experiences.

## Using Styles

When Ricardo (client manager) gathers project info, style preference should be captured. Options:

1. **Specific style**: User requests one of the above
2. **Style combination**: "Windows 98 meets Futuristic"
3. **Mood-based**: User describes a feeling, team selects appropriate style
4. **Chaos**: User provides no preference, team decides autonomously

The selected style should be communicated to all agents, particularly:
- **Pixel** (ideation): Grounds creative proposals in the style aesthetic
- **Mumble** (copywriter): Adapts writing approach to match
- **Viktor** (development): Implements style-appropriate interactions
- **Zara** (evaluation): Judges radicalness within style context
